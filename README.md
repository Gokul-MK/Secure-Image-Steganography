# Secure-Image-Steganography
#Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

#ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

#This project demonstrates Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography combined with AES Encryption for securely hiding messages inside images. It ensures data confidentiality while making hidden messages undetectable.

#ðŸš€ Features

#Dual Security: Combines Steganography with AES encryption.

#Minimal Image Distortion: The modified image looks unchanged.

#Colab Compatible: Can be run in Google Colab for easy execution.

#Secure Data Extraction: The original message can be successfully retrieved and decrypted.
