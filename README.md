# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography** combined with **AES Encryption** for securely hiding messages inside images. It ensures data confidentiality while making hidden messages undetectable.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Dual Security**: Combines Steganography with AES encryption.
- **Minimal Image Distortion**: The modified image looks unchanged.
- **Colab Compatible**: Can be run in Google Colab for easy execution.
- **Secure Data Extraction**: The original message can be successfully retrieved and decrypted.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `opencv-python` → Image processing
  - `numpy` → Array operations
  - `cryptography` → AES Encryption
  - `pillow` → Image handling

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- **Use DCT/DWT-based Steganography** for better security.
- **Implement AI-powered detection resistance**.
- **Build a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt** for better usability.
